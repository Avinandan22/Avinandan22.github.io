[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am a Sophomore Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur majoring in Computer Science and Engineering, broadly interested in the areas of Probabilistic Machine Learning and Deep Learning.\nMy sophomore year research work has been centered around using Tensors for Approximate Inference on multi-way and temporal data. Under the supervision of Prof. Ketan Rajawat, I developed a Tensor based model using Markov Chain Time Series for solving the problem of Traffic Estimation and Prediction.\nThe following Spring Semester(Jan20-Apr20) I have registered for EE609A(Convex Optimization in Signal Processing and Communications),CS771(Introduction to Machine Learning) and MTH535(An Introduction to Bayesian Analysis) and am very excited to explore and study these topics.\nI will be working with Prof.Soumendu Sundar Mukherjee the following month(December19) at Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata.\nLast summer I explored Probabilistic Machine Learning. I studied the preliminaries of Bayesian Inference, Non-Conjugacy and Conditional Conjugacy, Linear Models and Exponential Families, Latent Variable Models, EM and VI Algorithms, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. I worked on Recommender Systems using Bayesian Matrix Factorisation and Poisson Matrix Factorisation. I also explored Variational Autoencoders.\nIn my Freshmen Year, I was fascinated by Deep Learning. After learning the basics of Deep Learning, I spent quite some time exploring Generative Adversarial Networks.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve had some exposure to Natural Language Processing, though I\u0026rsquo;m much less acquainted with the subject that I\u0026rsquo;d like to be. I hope to explore NLP rigorously in the future.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Sophomore Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur majoring in Computer Science and Engineering, broadly interested in the areas of Probabilistic Machine Learning and Deep Learning.\nMy sophomore year research work has been centered around using Tensors for Approximate Inference on multi-way and temporal data.
