      <description>&lt;p&gt;Studied Change Point Detection Methods such as Page’s,Barnard’s,Shiryaev’s and Lorden’s procedures and newer approaches like Wild Binary Segmentation.Studied Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Topic Modelling.Studied the basics of NLP.Project in it’s initial stage.We are working on detecting change points in time series textual data, such as news topics over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Traffic Prediction using Variational Bayesian Inference for Tensor Factorisation and Completion</title>
      <link>/project/tensorcompletion/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2019 21:50:03 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/tensorcompletion/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Studied and understood paper on Variational Bayesian Inference for Robust Streaming Tensor Factorization and Completion by Cole Hawkins and Zheng Zhang. Explored avenues of Tensor Algebra, Low-rank Tensor Factorization and Time Series Forecasting. Studied and understood paper on Traffic Estimation via Online Variational Bayesian Subspace Filtering by Ketan Rajawat. Extended the findings in the above two papers by deriving an expression such that Tensor Factorization and Completion follows first order auto regressive model for its temporal component.Currently implementing the proposed model in MATLAB.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/project/pml/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Studied and understood preliminaries of Bayesian Inference, Non-Conjugacy and Conditional Conjugacy, Linear Models and Exponential Families, Latent Variable Models, Expectation Maximization Algorithm, Variational Inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Implemented model in NumPy for density estimation using Gaussian Mixture Models on MNIST dataset. Built a Recommender System using Bayesian Matrix Factorisation and studied and understood Poisson Matrix Factorisation. Built a Variational Autoencoder model on PyTorch to learn a low dimensional representation for handwritten digits.&lt;/p&gt;
