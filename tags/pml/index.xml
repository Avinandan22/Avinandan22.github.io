      <title>Traffic Prediction using Variational Bayesian Inference for Tensor Factorisation and Completion</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Studied and understood paper on Variational Bayesian Inference for Robust Streaming Tensor Factorization and Completion by Cole Hawkins and Zheng Zhang. Explored avenues of Tensor Algebra, Low-rank Tensor Factorization and Time Series Forecasting. Studied and understood paper on Traffic Estimation via Online Variational Bayesian Subspace Filtering by Ketan Rajawat. The project is currently in the initial stage. Derived a method in which the temporal component follows Time Series Markov Chain and the non-temporal component is expressed through CP decomposition of Tensors. Currently implementing the model to Traffic4cast challenge data set by HERE Technologies in association with IARAI and hope to make a successful submission. Also exploring techniques such as LDL Decomposition to reduce the Time Complexity of our computations for taking Matrix Inversions which is very important for fast predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Studied and understood preliminaries of Bayesian Inference, Non-Conjugacy and Conditional Conjugacy, Linear Models and Exponential Families, Latent Variable Models, Expectation Maximization Algorithm, Variational Inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Implemented model in NumPy for density estimation using Gaussian Mixture Models on MNIST dataset. Built a Recommender System using Bayesian Matrix Factorisation and studied and understood Poisson Matrix Factorisation. Built a Variational Autoencoder model on PyTorch to learn a low dimensional representation for handwritten digits.&lt;/p&gt;
